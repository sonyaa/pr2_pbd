This is the first version of RoboFlow (see ICRA 2015 paper: "RoboFlow: A Flow-Based Visual Programming Language for Mobile Manipulation Tasks"). It works for ros groovy and does not actually have a visual programming language editor - instead it has an rqt-based GUI. However, it does work for both top-down (starting from scratch) and bottom-up (starting with a demonstration) approaches.
